# Employee-and-Attrition-and-Performance

Employee Attrition Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict employee attrition using a random forest classifier. It utilizes a dataset containing information about employees, including various factors that may contribute to attrition. The code preprocesses the data, trains a random forest classifier, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Place the `employee_data.csv` file in the same directory as the project code.

2. Run the following command to execute the code:

   ```bash
   python employee_attrition_prediction.py
   ```

3. The program will output the following:

   - The first few rows of the loaded dataset.
   - Visualizations depicting the relationship between different factors and attrition.
   - Accuracy of the trained model on the test set.
   - Confusion matrix.

4. The program will also provide conclusions and recommendations based on the model's performance.
